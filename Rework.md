Rework 

##Ignore the real world

"That would never work in the real world."You hear it all the time when you tell people about a fresh idea.
This real world sounds like **awfully depressing** place to live .It's a place where new ideas ,unfamiliar approaches,and foreign concepts always lose.The only things that win are what people already know and do,even if those things are **flawed and inefficient**.
awfully 极端地,令人嫌恶地 
depressing 令人沮丧的
**Scratch** the surface and you'll find these "real world" **inhabitants are filled with pessimism and despair**.居民都充满了悲观和绝望。

They expect fresh concepts to fail.They assume society isn't ready for or capable of change.

Even worse,they want to drag others down into their tomb.If you're hopeful and **ambitious**,they'll try to convince you your ideas are impossible.They'll say you're wasting your time.
Do not believe them.That would may be real for them ,but is does not mean you have to live in it .
We know because our company fails the real-world test in all kinds of ways.In the real world,you can not have more than a dozen of employees spread out in eight defferent cities on tow continents.In the real world ,you can not attract millions of customers without any salespeople or advertising.In the real world,you can'nt **reveal** your formula for success to the rest of the world.But we've done all those things and **prospered**.

The real world isn't a place,it's an excuse.It's a justification for not trying.It has nothing to do with you.

##Learning from mistakes is overrated 

In the business world,failure has become an expected **rite** of passage.You hear all the time how nine out of ten new businesses fails.**You hear that you business's chances are slim to none**.You hear that failure builds character.People advise ,"Fail early and fail often."

With no much failure in the air,you can't help but breathe it in .Don't **inhale**.Don't get fooled by the stats.Other peoples's failures are just that:other people's failures.

if other people can't market their product,it has nothing to do with you.If other people can't build a team ,it has nothing to do with you.If other people can't price their services properly,it has nothing to do with you. If other people can't earn more than they spend...well,you get it .

Another common misconception:You need to learn from your mistakes.What do you really learn from mistakes?You might learn what not to do again,but how valuable is that?You still don't know what you should do next.

Contract that with learning from your successed.Success gives you real **ammunition**.When something succeeds,you know what worked--and you can do it again.And the next time,you'll probably do it even better.
Failure is not a prerequisite for success.A Harvard Business School study found already-successful entrepreneurs are **far more likely to** succeed again(the success rate for their future companies is 34 percent).But entrepreneurs whose companies failed the first time had almost the same **follow-on** success rate as people starting a comany for the first time ：just 23 percent.People who failed before who have never tried at all.Success is the experience that actually counts.

That shouldn't be a surprise:It's exactly how nature works.Evolution doesn't linger on past failures.it's always building upon what worked.So should you.

##Plan is guess

Unless you're a **fortune-teller**,long-term business planing is a fantasy.There are just too many factors that are out of your hands:market conditions,competitors,custumers,the economy,etc.Writing a plan makes you feel in control of things you can't actually control.
Why don't we just call plans what they really are:guesses.Start referring to your business plans as business guesses,your financial plans as financial guesses,and your strategic plans as strategic guesses.Now you can stop worrying about them as much.They just aren't worth the stress.
When you turn guesses into plans,you enter a danger zone.Plans let the past drive the future.They put **blinders** on you。“This is where we're going because,well,that's where we said we were going."And that's the problem:Plans are inconsistent with **improvisation**

And you have to be able to improvise.You have to be able to pick up oppotunities that come along.Somethings you need to say,"We're going in a new direction because that's what makes sense today.

It's OK to wing it .Just get on the plane and go.You can pick up a nicer shirt,shaving cream,and a toothbrush once you get there.
Working without a plan may seem scary.But blindly following a plan that has no relationship with reality is even scarier.

Why grow?

People ask,"How big is your company?"It's small talk,but they're not looking for a small answer.The bigger the number,the more impressive,professional,and powerful you sound."Wow,nice"they'll say if you have a hundred-plus employees.If you're small,you'll get an "Oh...that's nice."The former is meant as a **compliment**;the latter is said just to be polite.
Why is that?What is it about growth and business?Why is expansion always to the goal?What's the attraction of big besides ego.（You'll need a better answer than "economies of scale")What's wrong with finding the right size and staying there?
Do we look at Harvard or Oxford and say，“If they'd only expand and branch out and hire thousands more professors and go global and open other campuses all over the world...then they'd be great schools."of course not.That's not how we measure the value of these institutions.So why is it the way we measure businesses?
Maybe the right size for your company is five people.Maybe it's forty.Maybe it's two hundred.Or maybe it's just you and a laptop.Don't make assumptions about how big you should be ahead of time.Grow slow and see what feels right --**premature** hiring is the death of many companies.And avoid huge growth **spurts** too.--they can cause you to skip right over your appropriate size.

Small is not just a stepping-stone.Small is a great destination in itself.

Have you ever noticed that while small businesses wish they were bigger,big businesses dream about being more agile and flexible?And remember,once you get big,it's really hard to shrink without firing people,damaging **morale**,and changing the entire way you do business.
**Ramping** up doesn't have to be your goal.And we're not talking just about the number of employees you have either.It's also true for expenses,rent,IT infrastructure,furniture,etc.These things don't just happen to you.You decide whether or not to take them on.And if you do take them on,you'll be taking on new haadaches,too.Lock in lots of expenses and you force yourself into building a complex businesss--one that's a lot more difficult and stressful to run.
Don't be **insecure** about aiming to be a small business.Anyone who runs a business that's **sustainable** and profitable,whether it's big or small,should be proud.
