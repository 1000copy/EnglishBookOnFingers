Rework 

##Ignore the real world

"That would never work in the real world."You hear it all the time when you tell people about a fresh idea.
This real world sounds like **awfully depressing** place to live .It's a place where new ideas ,unfamiliar approaches,and foreign concepts always lose.The only things that win are what people already know and do,even if those things are **flawed and inefficient**.

**Scratch** the surface and you'll find these "real world" **inhabitants are filled with pessimism and despair**.

They expect fresh concepts to fail.They assume society isn't ready for or capable of change.

Even worse,they want to drag others down into their tomb.If you're hopeful and **ambitious**,they'll try to convince you your ideas are impossible.They'll say you're wasting your time.
Do not believe them.That would may be real for them ,but is does not mean you have to live in it .
We know because our company fails the real-world test in all kinds of ways.In the real world,you can not have more than a dozen of employees spread out in eight defferent cities on tow continents.In the real world ,you can not attract millions of customers without any salespeople or advertising.In the real world,you can'nt **reveal** your formula for success to the rest of the world.But we've done all those things and **prospered**.

The real world isn't a place,it's an excuse.It's a justification for not trying.It has nothing to do with you.

##Learning from mistakes is overrated 

In the business world,failure has become an expected **rite** of passage.You hear all the time how nine out of ten new businesses fails.**You hear that you business's chances are slim to none**.You hear that failure builds character.People advise ,"Fail early and fail often."

With no much failure in the air,you can't help but breathe it in .Don't **inhale**.Don't get fooled by the stats.Other peoples's failures are just that:other people's failures.
