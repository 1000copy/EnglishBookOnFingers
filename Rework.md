Rework 

##Ignore the real world

"That would never work in the real world."You hear it all the time when you tell people about a fresh idea.
This real world sounds like **awfully depressing** place to live .It's a place where new ideas ,unfamiliar approaches,and foreign concepts always lose.The only things that win are what people already know and do,even if those things are **flawed and inefficient**.
awfully 极端地,令人嫌恶地 
depressing 令人沮丧的
**Scratch** the surface and you'll find these "real world" **inhabitants are filled with pessimism and despair**.居民都充满了悲观和绝望。

They expect fresh concepts to fail.They assume society isn't ready for or capable of change.

Even worse,they want to drag others down into their tomb.If you're hopeful and **ambitious**,they'll try to convince you your ideas are impossible.They'll say you're wasting your time.
Do not believe them.That would may be real for them ,but is does not mean you have to live in it .
We know because our company fails the real-world test in all kinds of ways.In the real world,you can not have more than a dozen of employees spread out in eight defferent cities on tow continents.In the real world ,you can not attract millions of customers without any salespeople or advertising.In the real world,you can'nt **reveal** your formula for success to the rest of the world.But we've done all those things and **prospered**.

The real world isn't a place,it's an excuse.It's a justification for not trying.It has nothing to do with you.

##Learning from mistakes is overrated 

In the business world,failure has become an expected **rite** of passage.You hear all the time how nine out of ten new businesses fails.**You hear that you business's chances are slim to none**.You hear that failure builds character.People advise ,"Fail early and fail often."

With no much failure in the air,you can't help but breathe it in .Don't **inhale**.Don't get fooled by the stats.Other peoples's failures are just that:other people's failures.

if other people can't market their product,it has nothing to do with you.If other people can't build a team ,it has nothing to do with you.If other people can't price their services properly,it has nothing to do with you. If other people can't earn more than they spend...well,you get it .

Another common misconception:You need to learn from your mistakes.What do you really learn from mistakes?You might learn what not to do again,but how valuable is that?You still don't know what you should do next.

Contract that with learning from your successed.Success gives you real **ammunition**.When something succeeds,you know what worked--and you can do it again.And the next time,you'll probably do it even better.
Failure is not a prerequisite for success.A Harvard Business School study found already-successful entrepreneurs are **far more likely to** succeed again(the success rate for their future companies is 34 percent).But entrepreneurs whose companies failed the first time had almost the same **follow-on** success rate as people starting a comany for the first time ：just 23 percent.People who failed before who have never tried at all.Success is the experience that actually counts.

That shouldn't be a surprise:It's exactly how nature works.Evolution doesn't linger on past failures.it's always building upon what worked.So should you.

##Plan is guess

Unless you're a **fortune-teller**,long-term business planing is a fantasy.
