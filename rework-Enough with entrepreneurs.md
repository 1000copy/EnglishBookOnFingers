Enough with entrepreneurs

Let's retire the term entrepreneur.It's outdated and loaded with baggage.It smells like a members-only club.Everyone should be encourgeed to start his own business,not just some rare breed that self-inentifies as entrepreneurs.
There's a new group o people out there starting businesses.They're turning profits yet never think of themselves as entrepreneurs.A lot of them don't even think of themselves as business owners.They are just doing what they love on their own terms and getting paid of it.
So let's replace the fancy-sounding word with something a bit more down-to-earth.Instead of entrepreneurs,let's just call them starters.Anyone who create a new business is a starter.You don't need an MBA,a certificate,a fancy suit,a briefcase,or an above-average **tolerance** for risk.You just need a idea,a touch of confidence,and a push to get started.

Make a dent in the universe

To do great work,you need to feel that you're making a difference.That you're putting a meaningfull dent in the universe.That you're part of something important.
This doesn't mean you need to find the **cure** for cancer,It's just that your efforts need to feel valuable.You want your customers to say,"This makes my life better."You want to feel that if you stopped doing what you do,people would notice.

You should feel an urgency about this too.You don't have forever.This is your lift's work.Do you want to build just another me-too product or do you want to shake thing up?What you do is your legacy.Don't sit around and wait and wait for someone else to make the change you wnat to see.And donot think it take a huge team to make that differece either.
Look at Craiglit,which demolished the traditional classified-ad business.With just a few dozen employees,the company generates tens of millions in revenue,has one of the most popular sites on th Internet,and disrupted the entire newspaper business.
The Drudge Report,run by Matt Drudge,is just one simple page on the Web run by on guy.Yet it's had a huge impact on the news industry-telvision producers,radio talk show hosts and newpaper reporters routinely view it as the go-to place for new stories.

if you're going to do something,do something that matters.**These little guys came out of nowhere and destroyed old models tht had been around for decades**.You can do the same in your industry.

Scratch your own itch

The easiest,most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to make something you want to use.That lets you design what you know-and you'll figure out immediately whether or not what you're making is any good.
At 37signals,we build products we needed to run our own business.For example,we wanted a way to keep track of whom we talked to,what we said,and when we need to follow up next.So we created Highrise,our contact-management software.There was no need for focus groups,market studies,or middlemen.We had the itch,so we scratched it.
When you build a product or services,you make the call on hundreds of tiny decisions each day.If you're solving someone else's problem,you're constantly stabbing in the dark.When you solve your own problem,the light come on.You know exactly what the right answer is.
Inventor Jame Dyson scratched his own itch.While vacuuming his home,he realized his bag vacuum cleaner was constantly losing suction power-dust kept clogging the pores in the bag and blocking the airflow.It wasnot someone else's imaginary problem;it was a real one that he experientce firsthand.So he decided to solve the problem and came up with the world's first cyclonic,bagless vacuum cleaner.

Vic Firth came up with the idea of making a better drumstick while playing timpani for the bostom Symphony Orchestra.The sticks he could buy commercially didn't measure up to the job,so he began making and selling drumsticks from his basement at home.Then one day he dropped a bunch of sticks on he floor and heard all the different pitches.That's when he began to match up sticks by moisture content,weight,density,and pitch so they were identical pairs.The result became his product's tag line:Lthe perfect pair.Today,Vic Firth's factory turns out more than 85,000 drumsticks a day and has a 62 percent share in the drumstick market.

Track coach Bill Bowerman decided that his team needed better,lighter running shoes.So he went out to his workshop and poured rubber into the familly waffle iron.That's how Nike's famous waffle sole was born.

These people scratched their own itch and exposed a huge market of people who needed exactly what they needed.That's how you should do it too.

When you build what you need,you can also assess the quality of what you make quickly and directly,instead of by proxy.

Mary Kay Wagner,founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics,knew her skin-care products were great because she used them herself,She got them form a local cosmetologist who sold homemade foumulas to patients,relatives,and friends.When the cosmetologist passed away,Wagner bought the formulas from the family.She ditn't need focus groups or studies to know the products were good.She justhad to look at her own skin.

Best of all,this "solve your own problem" approach lets you fall in love with what youu 're making.You know the problem and the value of its solution intimately.There's no substitute for that.After all,you'll(hopefully)be working on this for years to come.Maybe even the rest of your life.It better be something you really care about.

###Start making something
	
We all have that one friend who says:"I had the idea for Ebay",if only I had acted on it,I'd be a billionaire!",That logicis pathetic and delusional.Having the idea for Ebay has nothing to do with actually creating Ebay.What you do is what matters,not what you think or say or plan.
Think your idea's that valuable?Then go try to sell it and see what you get for it.Not much is probably the answer.Until you actually start making something,your brilliant idea is just that,an idea.And everyone's got one of those.
Stanley Kubrick gave this advice to aspiring filmmakers:"Get hold of a camera and some film and make a movie of any kind at all."Kubrick knew that when you're new at something,you need to start creating.The most important thing is to begin.So get a camera,hit Record,and start shooting.
Ideas are cheap and plentiful.The original pitch idea is such a small part of a business that it's almost negligible.The real question is how well you execute.
