Enough with entrepreneurs

Let's retire the term entrepreneur.It's outdated and loaded with baggage.It smells like a members-only club.Everyone should be encourgeed to start his own business,not just some rare breed that self-inentifies as entrepreneurs.
There's a new group o people out there starting businesses.They're turning profits yet never think of themselves as entrepreneurs.A lot of them don't even think of themselves as business owners.They are just doing what they love on their own terms and getting paid of it.
So let's replace the fancy-sounding word with something a bit more down-to-earth.Instead of entrepreneurs,let's just call them starters.Anyone who create a new business is a starter.You don't need an MBA,a certificate,a fancy suit,a briefcase,or an above-average **tolerance** for risk.You just need a idea,a touch of confidence,and a push to get started.

Make a dent in the universe

To do great work,you need to feel that you're making a difference.That you're putting a meaningfull dent in the universe.That you're part of something important.
This doesn't mean you need to find the **cure** for cancer,It's just that your efforts need to feel valuable.You want your customers to say,"This makes my life better."You want to feel that if you stopped doing what you do,people would notice.

You should feel an urgency about this too.You don't have forever.This is your lift's work.Do you want to build just another me-too product or do you want to shake thing up?What you do is your legacy.Don't sit around and wait and wait for someone else to make the change you wnat to see.And donot think it take a huge team to make that differece either.
Look at Craiglit,which demolished the traditional classified-ad business.With just a few dozen employees,the company generates tens of millions in revenue,has one of the most popular sites on th Internet,and disrupted the entire newspaper business.
The Drudge Report,run by Matt Drudge,is just one simple page on the Web run by on guy.Yet it's had a huge impact on the news industry-telvision producers,radio talk show hosts and newpaper reporters routinely view it as the go-to place for new stories.

if you're going to do something,do something that matters.**These little guys came out of nowhere and destroyed old models tht had been around for decades**.You can do the same in your industry.
